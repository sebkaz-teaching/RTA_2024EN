    "text": "A streaming architecture is a defined set of technologies that work together to handle stream processing, which is the practice of taking action on a series of data at the time the data is created. In many modern deployments, Apache Kafka acts as the store for the streaming data, and then multiple stream processors can act on the data stored in Kafka to produce multiple outputs. Some streaming architectures include workflows for both stream processing and batch processing, which either entail other technologies to handle large-scale batch processing or use Kafka as the central store as specified in the Kappa Architecture.\nAn excellent real-time data processing architecture needs to be fault-tolerant and scalable; it needs to support batch and incremental updates and be extensible.\nIn the beginning, we explore two essential data processing architectures, Lambda and Kappa, that serve as the backbone of various enterprise applications."

    "text": "Lambda architecture\nLambda architecture comprises Batch Layer, Speed Layer (the Stream layer), and Serving Layer.\nThe batch layer operates on the complete data and thus allows the system to produce the most accurate results. However, the results come at the cost of high latency due to high computation time. The batch layer stores the raw data as it arrives and computes the batch views for consumption. Naturally, batch processes will occur at some interval and will be long-lived. The scope of data is anywhere from hours to years.\nThe speed layer generates results in a low-latency, near real-time fashion. The speed layer computes the real-time views to complement the batch views. The speed layer receives the arriving data and updates the batch layer results. The computation cost is significantly reduced thanks to the incremental algorithms implemented at the speed layer. The batch views may be processed with more complex or expensive rules and may have better data quality and less skew, while the real-time views give you up-to-the-moment access to the latest possible data.\nFinally, the serving layer enables various queries of the results sent from the batch and speed layers. The outputs from the batch layer in the form of batch views and the speed layer in the form of near-real-time opinions are forwarded to the serving layer, which uses this data to cater to the pending queries on an ad-hoc basis.\n \nImplementation Example:  \nGood\n\nGood balance of speed, reliability, and scalability.\nAccess to both real-time and offline results in covering many data analysis scenarios very well.\nAccessing a complete data set in a batch window may yield specific optimizations that make Lambda better performing and even simpler to implement.\n\nBad\n\nInternal processing logic is the same (batch and real-time layers) - many duplicate modules and coding.\nA data set modelled with Lambda architecture is difficult to migrate and reorganize."

    "section": "Kappa architecture",
    "text": "Kappa architecture\nThe Kappa Architecture is a software architecture used for processing streaming data. The central premise behind the Kappa Architecture is that you can perform real-time and batch processing, especially for analytics, with a single technology stack. It is based on a streaming architecture in which an incoming data series is first stored in a messaging engine like Apache Kafka. From there, a stream processing engine will read the data, transform it into an analyzable format, and then store it in an analytics database for end users to query.\nThe Kappa Architecture supports (near) real-time analytics when the data is read and transformed immediately after it is inserted into the messaging engine. This makes recent data quickly available for end-user queries. It also supports historical analytics by reading the stored streaming data from the messaging engine later in a batch manner to create additional analyzable outputs for more types of analysis.\nThe Kappa Architecture is a simpler alternative to the Lambda Architecture as it uses the same technology stack to handle real-time stream and historical batch processing. Both architectures entail the storage of historical data to enable large-scale analytics. Both architectures are also helpful in addressing “human fault tolerance,” in which problems with the processing code (bugs or known limitations) can be overcome by updating the code and rerunning it on historical data. The main difference with the Kappa Architecture is that all data is treated as a stream, so the stream processing engine acts as the sole data transformation engine.\n \nImplementation Example:  \n\nGood\n\nApplications can read and write directly to Kafka as developed. For existing event sources, listeners are used to streaming reports now from database logs eliminating the need for batch processing during ingress, resulting in fewer resources.\nQueries only need to look at a single serving location instead of going against batch and speed views.\n\n\n\nBad\n\nnot easy to implement, especially for the data replay.\n\n\n\nHow do the Lambda and Kappa compare?\nBoth architectures handle real-time and historical analytics in a single environment. However, one significant benefit of the Kappa Architecture over the Lambda Architecture is that it enables you to build your streaming and batch processing system on a single technology. This means you can build a stream processing application to handle real-time data, and if you need to modify your output, you update your code and then rerun it over the data in the messaging engine in a batch manner. As suggested by the Lambda Architecture, there is no separate technology to handle batch processing.\nWith a sufficiently fast-stream processing engine, you may not need a different technology optimized for batch processing. You read the stored streaming data in parallel (assuming the data in Kafka is appropriately split into separate channels, or “partitions”) and transform the data as if it were from a streaming source. For some environments, you can create the analyzable output on demand. When a new query is submitted from an end user, the data can be transformed ad hoc to answer that query optimally. Again, this requires a high-speed stream processing engine to enable low latency.\nWhile the Lambda Architecture does not specify the technologies that must be used, the batch processing component is often done on a large-scale data platform like Apache Hadoop. The Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) can economically store the raw data that can be transformed via Hadoop tools into an analyzable format. While Hadoop is used for the batch-processing component of the system, a separate engine designed for stream processing is used for the real-time analytics component. However, one advantage of the Lambda Architecture is that much larger data sets (in the petabyte range) can be stored and processed more efficiently in Hadoop for large-scale historical analysis."

    "section": "Apache Kafka",
    "text": "Apache Kafka\nOn Kafka website, you’ll find the definition of it right on the first page:\n\nA distributed streaming platform\n\nWhat is an “Distributed streaming platform”?\nFirst, I want to remind you what a stream is. Streams are just unlimited data, data that never end. It just keeps arriving, and you can process it in real time.\nAnd distributed? Distributed means that Kafka works in a cluster, and each node in the group is called Broker. Those brokers are just servers executing a copy of apache Kafka.\nSo, Kafka is a set of machines working together to be able to handle and process real-time unlimited data.\nHis distributed architecture is one of the reasons that made Kafka so famous. The Brokers make it resilient, reliable, scalable, and fault-tolerant. That’s why Kafka is so performer and secure. But why is there this misconception that Kafka is another messaging system?\nTo respond to that answer, we must first explain how messaging works.\n\nMessaging system\nMessaging, very briefly, it’s just the act of sending a message from one place to another. It has three principal actors:\n\nProducer: Who produces and sends the messages to one or more queues;\nQueue: A buffer data structure that receives (from the producers) and delivers messages (to the consumers) in a FIFO (First-In First-Out) way. When a notice is given, it’s removed forever from the queue; there’s no chance of getting it back;\nConsumer: Who is subscribed to one or more queues and receives their messages when published.\n\nAnd that is it; this is how the messaging works (very briefly, there’s a lot more). As you can see, there’s nothing about streams, real-time, or clusters (depending on your chosen tool, you can use a set too, but it’s not native, like Kafka).\n\n\nKafka architecture\nA lot of information You can find in this link.\nNow that we know how messaging works let’s dive into the Kafka world. In Kafka, we also have the Producers and Consumers; they work in a very similar way that they work in the messaging producing and consuming messages.\n \nAs you can see, it is very similar to what we’ve discussed about messaging, but here we don’t have the Queue concept. Instead, we have the idea of Topics.\nThe Topic is a particular type of data stream; it’s very similar to a Queue, it receives and delivers messages as well, but there are some concepts that we need to understand about topics:\n\nA topic is divided into partitions; each case can have one or more partitions, and we need to specify that number when creating the issue. You can imagine the topic as a folder in the operating system and each folder inside her as a partition. \nEach message will be stored in the broker disk and receive an offset (unique identifier). This offset is unique at the partition level; each partition has its owns offsets. That is one more reason that makes Kafka so special, it stores the messages in the disk (like a database, and in fact, Kafka is a database too) to recover them later if necessary. Different from a messaging system, the message is deleted after being consumed;\nThe consumer use the offset to read the messages, from the oldest to the newest. In case of consumer failure, it will start reading from the final place when it recovers.  \n\n\n\nBrokers\nAs said before, Kafka works in a distributed way. A Kafka cluster may contain many brokers as needed.\n \nEach broker in a cluster is identified by an ID and contains at least one topic partition. To configure the number of partitions in each broker, we need to configure something called Replication Factor when creating a topic. Let’s say we have three brokers in our cluster, a topic with three partitions and a Replication Factor of three; in that case, each broker will be responsible for one section of the issue.\nAs you can see in the above image, \\(Topic_1\\) has three partitions; each broker is responsible for a section of the topic, so the Replication Factor of the \\(Topic_1\\) is three. The number of partitions must match the number of brokers; in this way, each broker will be responsible for a single section of the topic.\n\n\nProducers\nJust like in the messaging world, Producers in Kafka are the ones who produce and send the messages to the topics. As said before, the messages are sent in a round-robin way. Ex: Message 01 goes to partition 0 of Topic 1, and message 02 to partition 1 of the same topic. It means that we can’t guarantee that messages produced by the same producer will always be delivered to the same topic. We need to specify a key when sending the message, Kafka will generate a hash based on that key and will know what partition to deliver that message. That hash takes into consideration the number of the partitions of the topic, that’s why that number cannot be changed when the topic is already created.\n\n\n\nConsumers and Consumers Groups\nConsumers are applications subscribed to one or more topics that will read messages from there. They can read from one or more partitions. When a consumer reads from just one partition, we can ensure the order of the reading, but when a single consumer reads from two or more partitions, it will read in parallel, so, there’s no guarantee of the reading order. A message that came later can be read before another that came earlier, for example. That’s why we need to be careful when choosing the number of partitions and when producing the messages.\nAnother important concept of Kafka is the Consumer Groups. It’s really important when we need to scale the messages reading. It becomes very costly when a single consumer needs to read from many partitions, so, we need o load-balancing this charge between our consumers, this is when the consumer groups enter.\nThe data from a single topic will be load-balancing between the consumers, with that, we can guarantee that our consumers will be able to handle and process the data. The ideal is to have the same number of consumers in a group that we have as partitions in a topic, in this way, every consumer read from only one. When adding consumers to a group, you need to be careful, if the number of consumers is greater than the number of partitions, some consumers will not read from any topic and will stay idle."

Modern methods of modeling by machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI), or deep learning not only allow better understanding of business, but also support making key decisions for it. The development of technology and increasingly new business concepts of working directly with the client require not only correct but also fast decisions. The classes offered are designed to provide students with experience and comprehensive theoretical knowledge in the field of real-time data processing and analysis, and to present the latest technologies (free and commercial) for the processing of structured data (originating e.g. from data warehouses) and unstructured (e.g. images, sound, video streaming) in on-line mode. The course will present the so called lambda and kappa structures for data processing into data lake along with a discussion of the problems and difficulties encountered in implementing real-time modeling for large amounts of data. Theoretical knowledge will be gained (apart from the lecture part) through the implementation of test cases in tools such as Apache Spark, Nifi, Microsoft Azure and SAS. During laboratory classes student will benefit from fully understand the latest information technologies related to real-time data processing."

    "text": "In recent times, a new way of handling data called stream processing has become important for companies big and small.\nIt’s like a supercharged version of how we used to work with data.\nThis new method is really good at solving the problems that old-fashioned data systems had trouble with, especially things like:\nStream processing offers several advantages over traditional batch processing methodologies:\nThis lecture aims to explain the growing excitement around stream processing and its transformative impact on data-driven application development.\nBefore we dive into stream processing, let’s first understand traditional data application architectures and their limitations.\nIn the past, data applications have mostly used batch processing. This means data is processed in separate chunks at specific times. Think of it like baking cookies - you can only bake as many as fit on the tray at one time.\nBatch processing works well in some cases, but it has problems when it comes to real-time data processing.\nImagine you’re trying to track the score of a live football game. If you’re using batch processing, you might only get updates at half-time and at the end of the game. This is because batch processing can cause delays, known as latency issues.\nBatch processing also has trouble scaling, which means it can’t always handle large amounts of data efficiently. It’s like trying to bake cookies for a whole city with just one oven!\nMoreover, batch processing is not very flexible. If the data changes or something unexpected happens, batch processing can’t adapt quickly. This can slow down businesses and prevent them from innovating.\nIn the next part of the lecture, we’ll discuss how stream processing can help overcome these limitations."

Systems like these have trained us to think of data in its resting state. When you need to process it, you run some query or job against the pile of bytes.\nThe advancement of information technology has revolutionized the way we access and utilize data. With the availability of vast amounts of both structured and unstructured data, new opportunities have emerged for scientific and business challenges.\nData plays a crucial role in the creation, collection, storage, and processing of information on an unprecedented scale. This has led to the development of numerous tools and technologies that enable us to harness the power of data.\nThanks to open-source software and the computing power of home computers, we can now tackle complex problems and explore new frontiers in various domains. The possibilities are endless as we continue to push the boundaries of data-driven innovation.\nThe new era of business and scientific challenges brings forth a multitude of opportunities:\n\nIntelligent advertising for thousands of products, targeting millions of customers.\nProcessing of data related to genes, RNA, or proteins, such as genus.\nIntelligent detection of fraudulent activities among hundreds of billions of credit card transactions.\nStock market simulations based on thousands of financial instruments.\n…\n\nAs we enter the data age, we face not only the challenge of handling large quantities of data but also the need for faster data processing.\nMachine learning algorithms rely on structured data in tabular form. This data is organized into columns representing characteristics that describe each observation or row. For example, these characteristics could include sex, height, or the number of cars owned. These features are used to predict whether a customer will repay a loan or not. This prediction is also included as a feature. By utilizing tables of features created in this manner, we can employ algorithms like XGBoost or logistic regression to determine the optimal combination of variables that influence the probability of a good or bad customer.\nUnstructured data refers to data that does not have a predefined structure or format, such as sound, images, and text. Unlike structured data, which is organized in a tabular form with columns and rows, unstructured data lacks a consistent organization.\nWhen processing unstructured data, it is often converted into a vector form to enable analysis and extraction of meaningful insights. However, individual elements like letters, frequencies, or pixels do not convey specific information on their own. They need to be transformed and analyzed collectively to derive valuable features and patterns.\nUnderstanding the distinction between structured and unstructured data is crucial for effective data processing and analysis.\n\nGive an example of structured and unstructured data. Load sample data in jupyter notebook.\n\n\nKnows the types of structured and unstructured data (K2A_W02, K2A_W04, O2_W04, O2_W07)"

For example, your phone alone generates a significant amount of data every day. This continuous generation of data is not limited to a specific time frame.\nBatch processing, which involves dividing data into chunks based on a specified time interval, is one approach to processing data. However, this approach may not always be suitable, especially when dealing with real-time data streams.\nTo handle the continuous flow of data from different sources, various systems have been designed, including data warehouses, IoT device monitoring systems, transaction systems, website analytics systems, internet advertising platforms, social media platforms, and operating systems.\nThese systems play a crucial role in processing and analyzing the data stream, enabling organizations to gain valuable insights and make informed decisions.\n\nA company is an organization that works and responds to a constant stream of data.\n\nIn traditional data processing, the input to the data source (and also the output of the evaluation) is typically a file. This file is written once and can be referenced by multiple functions or tasks.\nOn the other hand, in stream processing, data flows through a continuous stream of changes. This stream is generated by a source, often referred to as the “manufacturer”, “sender”, or “supplier”. The stream can be consumed by multiple recipients, known as “consumers”. The events in the stream are organized into topics.\nTopics serve as a way to group related events together, allowing for efficient processing and analysis of the streaming data."

    "section": "Data processing models",
    "text": "Data processing models\n\nTraditional Data Processing Model\nIn the traditional data processing model, businesses typically implement two types of data processing:\n\nOnline Transaction Processing (OLTP): This model is suitable for ongoing services such as customer service, order registration, or sales. It involves applications that interact with external services or human users and continuously process incoming events. When an event is processed, the application reads or updates its state by running transactions against a remote database system. This model provides effective solutions for data storage, transactional data recovery, data access optimization, concurrency management, and event processing.\nDatabase Query Model: Most of the data is stored in databases or data warehouses, and access to the data is implemented through queries via applications. This model focuses on the method of using and implementing the database access process. The two most commonly used implementations are:\n\nRelational Database Model: This model organizes data into tables with predefined relationships between them. It uses Structured Query Language (SQL) to perform operations such as querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data.\nData Warehouse Model: This model is designed for analytical processing and decision-making. It involves extracting, transforming, and loading data from various sources into a central repository, known as a data warehouse. The data in the warehouse is organized in a way that facilitates complex queries and analysis.\n\n\nUnderstanding these traditional data processing models is essential for businesses to effectively manage and process their data.\n\n\nThis model offers effective solutions for:\n\nEfficient and secure data storage\nTransactional data recovery in case of failures\nOptimization of data access\nConcurrency management\nEvent processing, involving reading and writing data\n\nIn addition to the benefits, the new data processing model and data warehouse database are particularly useful in scenarios involving:\n\nAggregation of data from multiple systems, such as consolidating data from various stores or branches.\nSupporting data analysis by providing a centralized repository for performing complex queries and analysis.\nGenerating data reports and summaries for business intelligence purposes.\nOptimizing complex queries to improve performance and efficiency.\nSupporting informed business decisions by providing reliable and up-to-date data.\n\nThese capabilities make the new data processing model and data warehouse database an ideal choice for organizations that require robust data management and analysis capabilities.\nResearch on such issues has led to the formulation of a new data processing model and a new type of database (Data warehouse).\nThis application design can cause problems when applications need to evolve or scale. Since multiple applications might work on the same data representation or share the same infrastructure, changing the schema of a table or scaling a database system requires careful planning and a lot of effort. Currently, many running applications (even in one area) are implemented as microservices, i.e. small and independent applications (LINUX programming philosophy - do little but right). Because microservices are strictly decoupled from each other and only communicate over well-defined interfaces, each microservice can be implemented with a different technology stack including a programming language, libraries and data stores.\nThis model provides effective solutions for:\n\neffective and safe data storage,\ntransactional data recovery after a failure,\ndata access optimization,\nconcurrency management,\nevent processing -&gt; read -&gt; write\n\nAnd what if we are dealing with:\n\naggregation of data from many systems (e.g. for many stores),\nsupporting data analysis,\ndata reporting and summaries,\noptimization of complex queries,\nsupporting business decisions.\n\nResearch on such issues has led to the formulation of a new data processing model and a new type of database (Data warehouse).\nThis application design can cause problems when applications need to evolve or scale.

After that, You can Transform Your data a more dynamically on demand.\nUse Case: - Demanding scalability requirements of Big Data - Streaming analytics - Integration of highly distributed data sources - Multiple data products from the same sources\nELT is an emerging trend: - Big Data -&gt; Cloud computing - ELT separates the data pipeline from processing - More flexibility - No information loss (by transformations)\nDifference between ETL and ELT\n\nTransformations for ETL happen within the data pipeline\nTransformations for ELT happen in the destination environment\nETL is rigid - pipelines are engineered to user specifications\nELT is flexible - end users build their transformations\nOrganizations use ETL for relational data, on-premise - scalability is difficult\nELT solves scalability problems, handling both structured and unstructured Big Data in the cloud\nETL workflows take time to specify and develop\nELT supports self-serve, interactive analytics in real time\n\nELT is the evolution of ETL! - increasing demand for access to raw data.\nETL still has its place for many applications: - Lengthy time-to-insight - Challenges imposed by Big Data - Demand for access to siloed information\n\n\nData Extraction Techniques\nExamples of raw data sources: - Paper documents - Web pages - Analog audio/video - Survey, statistics, economics - Transactional data - Social media - Weather station networks - IoT - Medical records - Human genomes\nData extraction techniques include: - OCR - ADC sampling, CCD sampling - Mail, phone, or in-person surveys and polls - Cookies, user logs - Web scraping - API’s - Database querying - Edge computing - Biomedical devices\n\n\nData Transformation Techniques\ncan involve various operations, such as: - Data typing - Data structuring - Anonymizing, encrypting - Cleaning: duplicate records, missing values - Normalizing: converting data to common units - Filtering, sorting, aggregating, binning - Joining data sources\n\nSchema-on-write\nis the conventional ETL approach: - Consistency and efficiency - Limited versatility\n\n\nSchema-on-read\napplies to the modern ELT approach: - Versatility - Enhanced storage flexibility = more data\nTransformed data could be loss information. - data compression - filtering - aggregation - Edge computing devices\n\n\n\nData Load Techniques\n\nFull\nIncremental\nScheduled\nON-demand\nBatch and stream\npush and pull\nparallel and serial"
