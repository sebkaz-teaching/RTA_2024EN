        "In recent times, a new way of handling data called `stream processing` has become important for companies big and small. \n",
        "\n",
        "It's like a supercharged version of how we used to work with data.\n",
        "\n",
        "This new method is really good at solving the problems that old-fashioned data systems had trouble with, especially things like:\n",
        "  - analyzing data, \n",
        "  - moving it around (ETL), \n",
        "  - handling transactions, \n",
        "  - building software, \n",
        "  - and finding new business ideas. \n",
        "\n",
        "Stream processing offers several advantages over traditional batch processing methodologies:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - **Real-time data processing**: Unlike batch processing, which deals with data in discrete chunks, stream processing allows for real-time or near-real-time data processing. This is crucial for applications that require immediate insights from their data.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  - **Scalability**: Stream processing systems are designed to handle large volumes of data. They can scale horizontally to accommodate data growth, making them suitable for big data applications.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  - **Fault tolerance**: Many stream processing systems are designed to be fault-tolerant. This ensures that data processing can continue uninterrupted, even if a part of the system fails.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  - **Integration with other systems**: Stream processing systems can often integrate with various data sources and sinks, making them versatile for different data pipelines. This makes it easier to build complex data processing workflows that involve multiple data sources and sinks.\n",
        "\n",
        "This lecture aims to explain the growing excitement around stream processing and its transformative impact on data-driven application development.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Before we dive into stream processing, let's first understand traditional data application architectures and their limitations. \n",
        "\n",
        "In the past, data applications have mostly used **batch processing**. This means data is processed in separate chunks at specific times. Think of it like baking cookies - you can only bake as many as fit on the tray at one time.\n",
        "\n",
        "Batch processing works well in some cases, but it has problems when it comes to real-time data processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Imagine you're trying to track the score of a live football game. If you're using batch processing, you might only get updates at half-time and at the end of the game. This is because batch processing can cause delays, known as latency issues.\n",
        "\n",
        "Batch processing also has trouble scaling, which means it can't always handle large amounts of data efficiently. It's like trying to bake cookies for a whole city with just one oven!\n",
        "\n",
        "Moreover, batch processing is not very flexible. If the data changes or something unexpected happens, batch processing can't adapt quickly. This can slow down businesses and prevent them from innovating.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the next part of the lecture, we'll discuss how stream processing can help overcome these limitations.\n",

        "Machine learning algorithms rely on structured data in tabular form. This data is organized into columns representing characteristics that describe each observation or row. For example, these characteristics could include sex, height, or the number of cars owned. These features are used to predict whether a customer will repay a loan or not. This prediction is also included as a feature. By utilizing tables of features created in this manner, we can employ algorithms like XGBoost or logistic regression to determine the optimal combination of variables that influence the probability of a good or bad customer.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Unstructured data** refers to data that does not have a predefined structure or format, such as sound, images, and text. Unlike structured data, which is organized in a tabular form with columns and rows, unstructured data lacks a consistent organization.\n",
        "\n",
        "When processing unstructured data, it is often converted into a vector form to enable analysis and extraction of meaningful insights. However, individual elements like letters, frequencies, or pixels do not convey specific information on their own. They need to be transformed and analyzed collectively to derive valuable features and patterns.\n",
